# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer using Deep CNN
![MNIST Dataset](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*26W2Yk3cu2uz_R8BuSb_SA.png)

   In this kernel, I have created a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize different handwritten digits and classify them. The dataset used here is actually from [Digit Recognition Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). 

**Frameworks**
* [Tensorflow v2](https://tensorflow.org) - A open sourced machine learning framework from Google.
* [Keras](https://keras.io) - A open sourced neural network library running on top of tensorflow.


### Process flow
1. Importing Libraries
2. Preparing the Dataset
3. Model Building
4. Model Fitting
5. Analyzing the model
6. Predicting the test data
